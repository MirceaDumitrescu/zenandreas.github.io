**ABOUT ME**

I have been working with computers for almost my entire life. Starting out as a passionate gamer since i was 16, quickly learned how make money from online projects. From small projects to larger ones, i have generally worked as project and community manager, leading teams and organizing the workflow of the teams, most of them in the online gaming industry.

I have closely worked with developers my entire career and ever since, i was intrigued my coding languages and learned a bit of everything since i needed to understand what the team was building. Never had the time or motivation to start on my own until 2020 when i sold my business and started to follow something i have always wanted. Coding.

Quickly realizing i fel in love with it and spent and invested my entire time into it. During this time i have learnt: Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Although i consider myself a beginner in all of the languages i have previously stated, i believe that my desire to learn and grow in this area of expertise is a great perk i proudly own. Determination and motivation.
